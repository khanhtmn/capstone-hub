Idea: This capstone will be a complete initial process for developing a new play that examines how wars and political conflict could influence one on an individual level. I intend to explore both the creative processes of playwriting( and directing) while at the same time examining the production processes using business lenses and skills. In produce a one-act play, and a sustainable business plan, I intended to explore the best practices for sustainable theatre practices. 

Method: The creative processes will be approached through a combination of theoretical research and experimentations based on these results. The exploration process will then be reflected for distilling findings through a write up.

Question: How might we use (musical) theatre as a medium to sustainably represent history and promote healing from historical traumas.

 Deliverables: 
- Literature review/ Thesis driven essay (10-15 pages)
- A one-act original play/ musical based on the true story of a couple during the Chinese civil war.  (60-90 Pages)
- Reflectional essay on the process, including finding through the experience and challenges faced (10-15 Pages)

(Optional:) 
- Director’s notebook: documenting the different production elements of this play, including an analysis and director’s approach for the production. This notebook should both include the higher level leading principles and style of performance while also presenting detail ideas like costume/set/light design. (Length Varies, approximately 30 pages)
- Pitch Deck:  A brief synthesis of the story, directorial ideas and business models and structures.  (15 Slides)

For example, the narrative surrounding Medusa is incomplete due to the central character's lack of autonomy and therefore warrants critical reexamination. Little research currently exists to cover the extent to which her myth has evolved alongside sociological development from the ancient Mediterranean to the present day -- and this project makes efforts to fill the academic gap. My Capstone has five parts: 1) adapting the main Medusa myth for a graphic novel reinterpretation, 2) contextualizing the history behind her evolving mythos and larger societal contexts, 3) addressing surrounding public discourse, 4) situating my work in existing academia, and 5) arguing that her story warrants further study. Although only one-fifth of the overall project, the light graphic novel nonetheless aims to return some agency to its protagonist by presenting Medusa from a perspective different from usual media portrayal (more a victim than a villain, a complex person instead of a monster). The academic paper complements the graphic novel not only by analyzing artistic choices and reasoning, but also contextualizing history and discourse surrounding the myth (particularly through historiographic, feminist, and identity-based analyses) -- all further supporting that portrayals of Medusa have evolved alongside society and will likely continue to change to match societal needs.","Mythology, ancient cultures, creative, illustrate, literature review, analysis, sociological development, storytelling, feminism, identity, art, history, social structures, representation","Creative (e.g., writing, art), Secondary research (e.g., literature review with analysis/synthesis and proposal for future work)",N/A (project does NOT involve interacting with any people and/or their information),"Film theory (especially visual theories and use of camera angles), creating graphic novels/comics, mythology, identity theories, mental health, neurological disorders, ptsd","#ah110primarysources, #ah110historicalperspective, #ah110historicalsilences, #ah110socialorder, #ah110identityanddifference, #ah112mediaanalysis, #ah112artcontext, #ah146readingstructures, #ah146framingdisciplines, #ah146rupturesanddislocations, #ah156ideasandbeliefs, #ah156socialdynamicsart, #ah156historicizeart, #ah156recontextualizeart, #ah166multimediaanalysis, #ah166produceart, #ah166expressart, #ss110psychologicallevel, #ss110interpersonallevel, #ss110grouplevel, #ss112socialdynamics, #ss112integratingtheories, #ss142emotioninfluenceoncognition, #ss162feedback, #ss162settinggoals",,Fiorelli,,,Berlin (GMT+2)

Deliberate destruction, careful preservation, or allowance of the natural processes of decay are all decisions on what to keep from the relentless beating of time and what to submit to it. The current condition of the heartland’s farmsteads is widespread abandonment with deteriorating barns dotting the rural landscape with the frequency of Starbucks in suburban stripmalls. The response to this allowance of decay need not only be lamentation. We can allow ourselves to admire and even romanticize this decay. The preservationist instinct to save all would amount to an entombed, static world.

This thesis will focus specifically on the deterioration of barns in Kane County Illinois, as well as an investigation into alternatives (museumification, repurposing) from local preservationist groups. There will be a photography and ‘driving tour of decay’ accompaniment. 

This project will apply concepts from European theorists and authors on ruins, typically centered on the Mediterranean, to a new context of contemporarily forsaken barns in rural Illinois. Two central thinkers are David Lowenthal’s ideas on heritage and the ‘continual refashioning’ of the past, and Rose Macaulay’s typology of ruin-pleasure.

There is an increasing amount of legal and ethical concern for game mechanics like Gacha due to its likeness to gambling and ‘predatory’ design that appears to target at-risk users, particularly due to the popularity and unrestricted nature of such games. The project aims challenge these criticisms and to use an in-depth case study of the chart-topping Gacha game, Genshin Impact, to explore the real-world consequences of such mechanics, the ethical dilemmas they evoke on behalf of different parties (such as users who play for free, users who habitually monetise, the game developers, etc.), and how other mechanics and experiences in the game affect those outcomes. As a product of this analysis, the project aims to provide a framework for game companies to employ Gacha mechanics (and Gacha-related systems) in an ethical manner, building upon King and Delfabbro’s (2019) framework for loot box mechanics.","business ethics, art ethics, game design","Creative (e.g., writing, art), Philosophical analysis, Policy analysis/proposal",N/A (project does NOT involve interacting with any people and/or their information),"Ethics in game making, ethics in potentially predatory business models, ethics in gambling.

Using Young Adult fantasy novels led by female protagonists as a target genre, the project will apply Robust Feminism to identify components of a novel that might be improved, offering a framework for assessing the state of feminism in a novel and improving weak aspects of its expression. Thus, the deliverables will be a theoretical synthesis of Intersectional and Queer Theory, case studies applying that theoretical synthesis to Young Adult fantasy novels, and a writer's guide about applying Robust Feminism in a Young Adult fantasy novel. Considering benefits of representation in the media for youth, constructing a guide for the effective expression of feminism in Young Adult fantasy literature critically assists authors in crafting more inclusive feminist stories.

There is a divergence between the normative considerations and the practical implications in regards to the perceived value of the Responsibility to Protect as a moral principle that generates an obligation to act.

LiveRoom was born after identifying the lack of monetization opportunities in the music industry. The issue stems from the fact that the main distribution channel of the music industry is streaming services that capitalize data but do not do micropayments. LiveRoom’s mission is to make music monetization more accessible by creating an online community and platform where musicians can create their own brands, network with music professionals, and monetize their work. 
There are three main components to the project. To begin with, an information deck explains the problem LiveRoom seeks to solve and presents LiveRoom as the solution. The second section describes and criticizes the development of LiveRoom based on Boudreau's framework of business creation (2017). This section also aims to describe future directions of LiveRoom as the idea is currently pivoting. The final section describes how the Capstone process has evolved with detailed LO and HC descriptions.

As such, the emergence of teacher-supplied private tutoring - a type of private tutoring that does not involve peer-to-peer interaction - remains to be one of the most significant consequences of regaining independence in post-soviet countries. Although qualitative studies confirm the effectiveness of private tutoring on national examination results (Silova, 2005), delivering college preparatory education in this format poses a number of challenges to complex social systems, such as increased corruption, disruption of high school education, and intensification of economic inequalities. In the final revision of my capstone proposal, I will use the research about the concept of private education in a post-socialist context to propose a prospective entrepreneurial intervention - an online course provider - that leverages the advantages of private tutoring while eliminating the attributive drawbacks reflected in today’s Georgian education system. Therefore, in this proposal, I deliver an in-depth descriptive research about the concept of private tutoring that will ultimately serve as a foundation for my startup concept. I also analyze and discuss the competitive landscape of private tutoring in its traditional and, in perspective, innovative formats, to explore the detailed pathway of leveraging an institutional void and turning it into a profitable startup that is capable of bringing about a significant social and economic change for the post-socialist countries.","Education, edtech, tutoring, corruption, institutional void, system disruption, startup, projections","Primary research (e.g., with a research group), Secondary research (e.g., literature review with analysis/synthesis and proposal for future work), Interview/survey, Data analysis, Business plan",N/A (project does NOT involve interacting with any people and/or their information),"Skills: Project planning, data analysis, retrospective research, effective communication, business ecosystem analysis, observational study, analytical thinking, agile project development approach.

Specific question: How might we help Chinese college students who wish to solve their SNS addictions reduce their addictive behavior towards social networks by changing their usage patterns and desire to browse?

Specific idea: Social network site (SNS) addictions arise as an emerging problem in modern society. While electronic devices are only mediators of addictive behavior, social media are at the center of causing addictions (Serenko & Turel, 2020). Existing solutions are not sufficient to help people to solve SNS addiction. Through employing behavioral science and human-centered product development, the project will demonstrate that appropriate behavioral mechanisms can help Chinese college students who wish to solve their SNS addictions reduce their addictive behavior towards social networks by changing their usage patterns and desire to browse. 

The target audience of the problem would be Chinese college students who wish to improve their usage of SNS. Thus, the project will explore systematic means to help the audience change their habit by employing behavioral design techniques such as nudging, priming, reward learning, choice architecture, and gamification. Additionally, since humans are the center of the solution, I would adopt IDEO's human-centered design thinking approach to ensure the solution would genuinely serve the users.

Methods: design thinking, behavioral science, human-centered design (interview/survey: need interview, ideation interview, live prototyping, etc.), habit breaking

Intended outcome: users could solve their SNS-addiction and change usage habits as they wished.

Deliverable: an academic paper discussing employing behavioral science and human-centered design to solve SNS addiction and a product that implements the findings to help users solve the SNS addiction problem.

The industry has been favoring more sustainable and ethical brands as the consumers become aware of the existing problems. The ethical fashion brands practice green branding or green marketing to attract the conscious consumers. However, some brands started greenwashing by misleading the consumers to increase sales and brand reputation. Greenwashing is harmful to the brand reputation and the overall ethical fashion market as consumers become more skeptical once greenwashing is exposed. Thus, it is important for sustainable fashion brands to differentiate green marketing from greenwashing. The project aims to provide cohesive background and analysis on greenwashing and green marketing through a thematic literature review, providing green marketing criteria and mini case studies as a demonstration for effective use of the criteria.  

Guiding Questions: 
How might we distinguish greenwashing from green marketing?
How might we help businesses effectively communicate their sustainability practices?

What is the impact of social support on the success of Basic Income programs? One of the most tragic manifestations of rising inequality is the increasing levels of homelessness - a complex problem that has plagued the United States for decades. Welfare and shelter programs have long been the predominant ways to lift people out of poverty, and recently, Basic Income (BI) programs have resurfaced and gained popularity as a possible part of the solution. However, both BI and welfare programs typically focus on only satisfying the basic physiological needs of individuals - food and shelter. Yet, humans have just as important “higher level” needs as well, like psychological safety and social connection. Those experiencing homelessness often experience relational poverty - the lack of social capital. Without adequate social support, people experiencing homelessness tend to stay homeless. This paper argues that to successfully eradicate homelessness, we cannot just throw money at the poor - we need to consider the importance of building social capital as well, which will require a fundamental shift in the way society perceives and stigmatizes homelessness. Findings from a real-world case study (Miracle Money by Miracle Messages) suggest that a combined cash transfer plus social capital-building program has the potential to make a positive impact on recipients’ ability to secure housing, well-being, and social support systems.","Basic Income, Relational Poverty, Homelessness","Primary research (e.g., with a research group), Secondary research (e.g., literature review with analysis/synthesis and proposal for future work), Interview/survey, Data analysis, Program Evaluation",Reviewed by HSR committee: *NOT* HSR,"Social capital, Universal Basic Income (UBI) models, Relational poverty, Complex systems analysis, Sustaining a non-profit, Scaling social impact and social change.","#b110whyexist

Specific idea: 
TL;DR A guidebook on cohesive use of sensory marketing in the context of online and offline grocery stores.

While sensory stimuli in physical spaces are well established, their consistent translation to the online spaces is not implemented as commonly. That is problematic, as sensory marketing tools help establish the shopping environment that evokes specific feelings and forms customer experience. If the same feeling is not achieved when shopping with a different store channel, the experience is not consistent. Customers have little patience for variability, which harms customer satisfaction, so grocery stores need to ensure consistent experiences to retain their audience.

Digital transformation enables efficiency, economies of scale, and scope. 

The lack of successful digital transformation is more prevalent in Sub-Saharan countries like Rwanda than in the rest of the world. Sub-Saharan Africa has the lowest internet penetration of 24.1% compared to the other global average above 60% (Simione & Woldemichael, 2020). However, the businesses that invested in digitization initiatives, no matter how minimal, experienced impressive results. For example, firms that use emails 10% more had 37-38% revenue growth despite the unfavorable global pandemic (OECD, 2021). Digital transformation, however, is at a broader scale and exceeds digitization to sometimes rethink how a business is operated. So, it is highly likely that DT would produce even more significant business results. 

This project will deliver a set of actionable steps for SMEs in Rwanda to enable successful digital transformation initiatives. The recommendations will come from thorough case studies I will conduct analyzing both successful and failed initiatives, to identify the driving factors of DT success. Given that most of the existing literature is designed for more developed countries, I plan to add more nuances of an emerging market such as the low internet penetration rate mentioned above.","Small and medium enterprises (SMEs), working capital, and digital transformation","Secondary research (e.g., literature review with analysis/synthesis and proposal for future work), Policy analysis/proposal, Business plan",Have not submitted a description yet,"Analytical skills - quantitative using tools like R and SQL.

This project examines the overlaps and gaps between the theoretical frameworks on experience design developed by academia and the insights and tools that practitioners in the field rely on. My research question is How to develop a universal experience design guide encompassing theoretical frameworks and industry practices? The organizational approach consists of four steps. In the first one, I examine the theoretical frameworks developed by academia and synthesize them into a single flowchart encompassing the most common elements in chronological order of consideration. In the second one, I compile the information gathered from interviews with practitioners and develop an analogical figure encompassing the trends across the industry. In the third one, I do a comparative analysis between the two to examine the gaps and overlaps.  In the fourth step, I develop the Experience Design Guide which constitutes a universal and sufficient step-by-step list of the actions and considerations that experience designers should go through in their practice. The deliverable guides designers through the four necessary steps: identifying objectives, using relevant tools, theming, and considering emotions. The structure of the guide strikes a balance between sequential order and acknowledging the loop-like relationships between steps.

Purpose: Every year, 700000 Bangladeshi high school students drop out after high-school and are unable to attend universities. Not because of their lack of talent, but because Bangladesh doesn’t have enough university seats for such a large population. On the other hand, nearly 80,000 students from Bangladesh go to universities abroad every year. I myself have sought help from seniors in learning about the admission process and how to secure scholarships simply by being well informed.

Through CrossRoads, we want to connect the university students with high school students, so that the first group can help mentor the latter group with information like Common Application, SAT examination preparation, IELTS etc.
Intended Deliverable: In this project, I wish to create an application that connects students with mentors, and secondly, I wish to create a business plan (pitch deck) that helps the product grow after my graduation.
Guiding Question: “How can we create an web-app and deploy an organized business plan that allows us to help 1000 high-school students get into universities abroad?”
In this project, I wish to create an application that connects students with mentors, and secondly, I wish to create a business plan (pitch deck) that helps the product grow after my graduation.

Situated at the intersection of structured finance and fiscal policy, this challenge question animates my capstone project: To what extent could financial instruments help commodity-dependent developing countries hedge their fiscal accounts’ commodity price risk?

Deliverable
The project aims to create a technical note to be used by sovereign entities as a preliminary analysis of their commodity risk exposure and potential costs and benefits related to using commodity linked-bonds versus derivatives as hedge instruments.

Approach:
Assessing the fiscal risk and devising a financial instrument for each country is divided into the four steps mentioned below:
1. Quantify Direct Net Exposure: Estimating the revenues tied to the rents (taxes and royalties, in most cases) from commodity exports. 
2. Run Basic Sensitivity Analysis: A sensitivity analysis of the exposure to price fluctuations over a period of 5 years.
3. Structure & Price an Option: Structuring and pricing a put option as well as a commodity-linked bond.
4. Scenario Analysis: Scenario analysis for the payoff of each financial instrument using the Monte Carlo method.

After working in Kenya's insurance sector for almost two years, I want to do an in-depth analysis of insurance practices in Kenya and research on how to encourage more people to buy insurance - specifically, health insurance.

Currently, only 2 out of 10 Kenyans have health insurance cover, and I want to analyze how the uptake can be increased. Therefore, I shall analyze the reasons why people are reluctant to pay for insurance and look for potential solutions that would encourage people to buy insurance. This means creating public awareness about the importance of having health insurance, as well as evaluating how to make insurance premiums easily accessible and available to everyone. 

I shall conduct thorough research on the insurance laws in Kenya, insurance companies & brokers, internal processes & systems, risks, macroeconomic & microeconomic issues, insurance premiums charged & how to pay them, the benefits, how to file claims, exclusions, how to identify a suitable insurance plan & cover. 

I shall also compare different insurance plans, domestically and internationally, including quantitative information - this involves analyzing financial statements (balance sheet, income statement, and cash flow statements), financial ratios, and marketing strategies used.

I will do an all-round analysis of insurance in Kenya to have substantial knowledge to identify the advantages & disadvantages of strategies, and make recommendations.

FINAL DELIVERABLE: A Policy proposal, that is customized and suitable for Kenyans. 
I shall also provide identify additional resources such as useful apps, business plans and websites to support my analysis & and provide insurance information.

Often relying on data from comparable companies further along the growth cycle, abstract assumptions, and previous financial multiples, resulting valuations contain a myriad of biases and can often ignore the heightened vulnerability of failure that rapidly growing, early-stage companies face. 
Furthermore, while business and macroeconomics researchers have evaluated several different models for quantifying the economic impact of financial inclusion, negligible attention is given to the vast systemic, economic value-add these digital disruptive companies create within emerging markets. Consumers shifting preferences have heightened the importance of Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) initiatives, increasing both positive and negative effects of a company’s position on social change. However, the social impact performed by companies is often difficult to quantify, including a variety of associated economic factors and stakeholders. In this Capstone, I will conduct an initial coverage report of Tala, using a modified approach to support two primary claims:
1.	Current methods of enterprise valuation are incomplete without addressing the radical new characteristics of technology startups. (Scalability, lack of physical infrastructure necessitating a lean process, the magnitude of the problem addressed)
2.

The consequences of this gender imbalance in technology are many. A study by McKinsey shows that the greater the gender representation in a company, the more likely the organization is to outperform competitors. In fact, the most gender-diverse companies have a 48% greater likelihood of outperforming the least gender-diverse organizations (Dixon-Fyle et al., 2020). However, current hiring platforms, hiring practices, and workplace culture do not promote gender equality in technology. This project aims to analyze how current hiring systems and business culture fail women in technology and suggest better approaches through Dupla's case study and an exploratory data analysis that characterizes gender-diverse companies and women in tech.

Many people want to make progress in one or more areas of their lives, but it’s hard to work consistently towards these goals and see results. Every year, millions of people make New Year’s resolutions yet see them falling through only after a few weeks.

People find a hard time committing to anything because
1) No place exists to explore what works for them
2) It's hard to find people with the same goal and interest

To make consistent progress, one benefits a lot from a community of people doing the same/similar thing. When feeling connected and belonged in a community, people help each other take action towards their goals and make progress. When people start making progress as part of a community, the journey becomes even more enjoyable, and they want to help others in the community.

The main deliverables of this project would be an iOS app and a case study in building a mobile app to help people make consistent progress towards their goals by enabling them to 1) create a small group over their shared goal, 2) commit together, and 3) share the journey with the community.","mobile app, iOS app, community, make progress, find hobby, goals, social, lifestyle","Business plan, App",N/A (project does NOT involve interacting with any people and/or their information),"mobile app dev, writing business plans ","#B110customerCentricity, #B110whyExist, #B110consumerBehavior, #B110marketAnalysis, #B111bizfunctions, #CS110ComputationalCritique, #CS110ComputationalSolutions, #CS110DataStructures, #CS110PythonProgramming, #CS110CodeReadability, #CS146PythonImplementation, #CS146Professionalism, #CS162webstandards, #CS162agile, #CS162communication, #CS162sql, #CS162deployment, #CS162testing, #CS162abstraction, #CS162separationofconcerns","#techsolution: Apply appropriate research methods, frameworks, and tools to identify and validate consumer needs and propose and build a prototype or complete web/mobile application.

For example, I do not like Indian food then even when Indian food is recommended, I do not eat. In our system, it will not suggest Indian food
- Eating out with friends is hard to choose the best suitable food for everyone. My system will approach this question in two directions. First of all, if users have data in the system then we can recommend them to choose the food that help them follow their current meal plan. Secondly, users can add food they like and other people can vote to have it or not (a Tinder for food)

I focus on target users in specific context: eating out individuals or in groups (how we can choose best suitable food for everyone); generate a meal plan for individuals based on other meals (what healthy food should I eat to have all necessary nutrition and follow their plan: lose weight, gain weight, etc.)

Intended outcomes: A website to provide one expert system about nutrition that can return the suitable food for daily choice by keeping track of the calories from food and suggesting foods based on preference.

We have graduated 3 classes, which yields approximately 450 Capstone projects. With more students graduating in the future, we are in need of a scalable solution to store and retrieve information about the Capstone projects efficiently. Our current system is Google Spreadsheet, with each class information stored in one separate spreadsheet. This proves to be challenging for the administrator to manage cross-class information and for students to access Capstone information from different classes. For all of those reasons, I’m working on a website that has all information about Capstone projects so that students can search for Capstone information more easily and the administrators can manage all of the data in one place.   


Big question: How might we develop a platform that would enable Minerva students to store and search for Capstone information more easily?


Intended deliverables: 
(1) A full-stack website with working front-end and back-end
(2) Each student would have an account to manage their Capstone information (instead of filling out the Google Form)
(3) Search functionality so that users can filter information based on keywords and criteria
(4) An admin page for administration purpose (like edit student class if they take a leave of absence, and view students’ history of updating their Capstone information for assignment grading)
(5) Migration script to backfill Capstone data from M19s to M22s to the database

Stretch goal:
(1) A page to view all faculty advisors and their interest
(2) Functionality to match students with faculty advisors

- Best engineering practices in developing a web app
- How to build a maintainable, highly scalable web app

Specific idea: Understanding MIP*=RE

MIP*=RE is a new (2020) breakthrough in quantum computational complexity theory. It gives a reduction from the Halting Problem to the problem of deciding whether a two-player nonlocal game has entangled value 1 or at most 1/2, i.e. whether a language is in the MIP* complexity group. This is an extension beyond the older complexity groups like IP, QIP and MIP. It combines knowledge from CS142 & NS142 as well as CS164, and connects to further topics like group theory.

I would like to create an explanatory/exploratory interactive website that presents the steps of the proof and the complexity classes involved in a lighter tone than the 200-page paper. Inspired by the likes of Parable of Polygons, I want it to be interactive and playful, but explain the concepts at the same time. The crux of this is choosing suitable examples for the different complexity classes.

Currently, my biggest questions are about the visual form of the website and about the target audience, or level of difficulty, of the explanations.","computational complexity, interactive proofs, CS142, halting problem, web development, interactive explanation","Creative (e.g., writing, art), Primary research (e.g., with a research group), Secondary research (e.g., literature review with analysis/synthesis and proposal for future work), Data visualization and explanation website",N/A (project does NOT involve interacting with any people and/or their information),"CS142, CS162, NS142, CS164.

However, there are already multiple apps and software that easily allows consumers and stores that don't really have a good financial background to acquire digital wallets.

Specific Idea: Developing a model which will use image recognition and supervised learning techniques to keep tracks of on-shelf availability. 

Method/Approach: 
Using supervised learning techniques such as:
-  Support vector machines (SVM): using them for the classification of objects in images
-  Convolutional neural networks: to detect changes in shelves and classify those 
       changes e.g.
              a. product replenished
              b. product taken

Image processing technology: using images to update shelf condition so that the algorithm can inform us about the presence/absence of products based on the prior condition (initial picture of the shelf) 

Intended outcomes:
- Training one or more models to recognize ranges of products based on their packaging, knowing how to count how them, and inform the person in charge when replenishment is needed.
- Comparing the performance of those models","computer vision, machine learning, deep learning, classification, image recognition","Secondary research (e.g., literature review with analysis/synthesis and proposal for future work), Data analysis, Business plan, Commented Code: implementing a ML model",N/A (project does NOT involve interacting with any people and/or their information),"Deep Learning, Neural Networks, transfer learning, object recognition in Python (using different libraries such as opencv, openvino, yolo etc), image processing technology","#cs156-Overfitting, #cs156-NeuralNetworks, #cs156-Classification, #cs146-summarystatistics,  #cs110-ComputationalSolutions,#cs110-CodeReadability, #cs110-computationalcritique, #cs156-ModelMetrics","#ComputerVision : Apply and interpret computer vision methods/techniques for a given

Affinity Mapping is one such tool that helps problem-solvers identify themes from ideas proposed in a brainstorming session or insights gained from user research. 

Although a common and useful tool, the grouping of information could be lengthy and subject to biases especially when the number of insights is large. Imagine a room of 100 community resident throwing in 10 ideas about what they want to change about the community––manually organizing all 1000 ideas would take way too much time. 

Therefore, this project aims to use the Affinity Propagation algorithm to automatically cluster insights into themes.

These gender imbalances manifest themselves throughout several parts of the venture capital funding pipeline. Using agent-based modeling techniques and complexity science, this project aims to examine the effects of these gender imbalances to better understand the interactions between the different stages of the funding pipeline and be better poised to devise solutions with the largest amount of impact.

Machine Learning (Sentiment analysis and Natural language Processing)

Main idea: 
Lagosians report being unclear on which Internet Service Providers (ISPs) are good in Lagos, Nigeria (or more specifically, which ISPs are best for them to use). However, they also fail to consider that the better ISP is largely dependent on their location in the state. My project looks to solve for this problem by narrowing down to the different Local Government Areas (LGAs) in Lagos and determining which ISPs have the best service in these areas. This is achieved through a mixed-methods analysis approach with the qualitative component being sentiment analysis (machine learning) and the quantitative component being a survey analysis. The end goal is to provide currently unavailable location-informed answers to the question 'Which ISPs are the best in Lagos,' by breaking Lagos down to a more meaningful and informative scale of LGAs. This should ultimately inform future purchase decisions of citizens as well as highlight areas of improvement for ISPs.

- Mixed-methods Approach:
    - Sentiment Analysis
    - Survey Analysis

- Academic report 
- Dashboard highlighting the different LGAs and highest ranked ISPs

A better understanding of the ecological interactions driving population dynamics will allow us to build better predictive models and shape conservation policies.  The existing models used to determine climate change impact in terrestrial species are simplistic and lack integration of complex interactions within the ecosystems.  Features such as cross-scale interactions, foraging behavior, reproductive timing, parent-offspring phenotypic correlation, trait dynamics, predator-prey interactions, phenology, and migratory patterns are shown to be important components of ecological complexity that influence population growth and dynamics. My project aims to present a succinct introduction to the population dynamics and climate change modeling literature for terrestrial species. My final capstone product will be a literature review that highlights the progress so far in the field of modeling ecological climate change impacts and the gaps that remain based on theoretical applications of complexity science that have not been applied yet to ecology.

correlation with the temperature of chemical reactions. Theoretical predictions of the clumped isotopologues enrichment of a chemical reaction in equilibrium are computed using the Reduced Partition Function Ratio (RPFR) for the involved reactants and products. The UBM (Urey-Bigeleisen-Mayer Model) model expresses the RPFR as a function of the vibrational frequencies for a molecule before and after isotopic substitutions. In this project, I built predictive models for the RPFR using the bonding structure of a substituted isotopologue. I created a dataset of the RPFR for all singly and doubly-substituted isotopologues for several organic molecules, including C1-C12 Alkanes, monosaccharides, and simpler amino acids using DFT/b3lyp/6-31G* level of theory. I then built an exponential regression model and a gaussian processes regression model using the computed RPFR and features of the singly and doubly substituted isotopologues. I found that the exponential regression accurately predicts the RPFR for clumped carbon in alkanes. Both models failed to accurately predict the RPFR for clumped isotopologues of monosaccharides and amino acids. With the substantial number of possible
clumped isotopologues for even smaller molecules, theoretical predictions reliant on the
computation of vibrational frequencies are not feasible with today’s computational power.
Predictive models can thus be used to predict the enrichment in clumped isotopologues for
geochemical relevant reactions.","Clumped Isotopologues, predictive models, DF","Primary research (e.g., with a research group)",N/A (project does NOT involve interacting with any people and/or their information),"Report writing, research, and data science","#NS111elementstominerals, #NS146surfacegeochem, #CS166CodeReadability, #CS166Modelling",,Howe,"Molecular Dynamics, geochemistry, geoscience in general, data science",Predictive modeling!

Specific idea: Climate change is nonlinear, often feels psychologically distant for many individuals, and is a public goods dilemma, making it challenging to take action on. Research has shown that communicating climate change as a human health problem rather than an environmental problem is effective in addressing the obstacles individuals have when thinking, discussing, and acting on climate change. Through focusing on health, one of the top human values, people feel more affected by climate change, which overcomes some psychological and cognitive obstacles.

Question: “How might we analyze and convey the human health impact of particulate matter (PM2.5) to engage cautious Minnesotans in Minneapolis on the topic of climate change?”

Intended deliverables: 
I have three main deliverables:
1. A literature review on science communication and why framing climate change as a human health problem rather than as an environmental problem is strategic and necessary for cautious and disengaged Minnesotans in Minneapolis specifically.
2. Scientific report on the human health impact of PM2.5 in Minnesota. This report will be created specifically for an audience of cautious Minnesotans in Minneapolis. 
3. Brochure - This deliverable summarizes the second deliverable and will be more accessible, shorter version

My intended approach to create the second deliverable will be grounded in science communication principles based on my own scientific analysis on air quality through the use of publicly-available government data via (https://fire.airnow.gov). I will analyze the data through the PWFSLSmoke R package. I will use pre-existing research available through the Claremont Database to identify the impact the level of PM2.5 has on human health.

Building up quantum technologies like quantum repeaters, it is necessary to produce high-efficiency entanglement photon pairs with a high degree of indistinguishability, purity, and entanglement (Wei et al., 2014; Hube et al., 2017; Flagg et al., 2010). Current researchers are looking for an efficient method for the production and scalability of entanglement photon pairs sources.  In particular, there is a potential dipole-coupled emitter model for deterministic photon-pairs sources with a two-three level system (Wang et al., 2020). The model is theoretical, and it consists of an emitter with a ground state and two active, excited states with orthogonal transition dipole moments. This model allows the symmetric excited state of the pair to have a radiative decay cascade based on defects, resulting in the emission of two entangled photons with orthogonal polarization. The model is only mathematical; thus, one particular question that I had is: What are potential existential materials that could behave similarly to the model. It is essential to state that emitters could be molecules, atoms, metals that emit photons.  Another question is, How would the model behave if we work outside of some constraints, such as constant dipole moment, circular polarization? These are the questions I am exploring as my capstone. Answering the first question can help researchers pick these potential materials to conduct experiments to help advance quantum technologies and build up a database of historical experiments results to advance quantum technologies such as quantum repeater, information processing, quantum cryptography, and quantum metrology. 


Method: Reading experiments on some known materials for quantum technologies (mostly defects in diamonds, h-BN, silicon carbide... etc) to find out if their variables would fit the model (energy level, dipole-coupled moment and transition) by looking into results and feeding into a Mathematica code ( based on quantum mechanics) to calculate if it will produce entangled photon pairs.

Specific Idea: Black holes are notorious for being very difficult to study directly/observe. But, we can create physical systems in laboratories which are mathematically analogous to gravitational black holes. Many people have tried to explore whether these physical systems can teach us anything about their gravitational counterparts. This is a relatively new field, which is just starting to gain traction and studied extensively. It lacks any good literature review or a resource which can act as a systematic learning resource or place for condensation of knowledge. My goal is to write a resource on the analogue methods used to study Black Holes. This would mean building up the prerequisite knowledge for Analogue Black Holes and explaining it to everyone. Ideally, the resource would be self-contained and a university physics student would not have to look outside the resource for more understanding.
The major component of the project will be trying to explain the mathematical equations and analogies to non-specialized audiences while still being rigorous and staying true to the equations.

Deliverables: A series of blog posts about Analogue Black Holes and the prerequisite knowledge required + a discussion/critique of a paper on whether the phenomena in Analogue systems should named the same as the phenomena in real physical systems.

Purpose: The purpose is to create a sort of hub for all the information regarding analogue black holes explained by assuming the most minimal knowledge. This will serve as a sort of introduction to anyone who wants to pursue the direction of analogue gravity. Therefore, it must explain the equations and analogies in general and in specific systems, and give a breakdown and summary of the research and results that have already been done. 
The personal purpose for doing this is to learn more about black holes and the theory behind it.

Approach/Methodology: My current approach is to search for papers in the common databases (Google Scholar, WorldCat) and select papers which explain and build the theory for analogue black holes. I intend to choose just the Sonic/Acoustic Black Holes for now. I would try to understand these papers and make a list of topics that one would need to know before hand to understand these systems.
For the prerequisite knowledge, I will be relying heavily on General Relativity courses, other online courses, and papers which explain certain components of analogies.

Guiding Question: How do journalism and activism interact amidst social movements in the contemporary digital information landscape?

Main Idea: Reconsidering the mutually influential dynamics of journalism and activism based on their functioning within and across contemporary human rights social movements. The working thesis of the project is that, due to digitization and globalization, journalism and activism demonstrate a bidirectional, continuum-based relationship of simultaneously challenging, supporting, and neglecting each other such that journalism is still necessary, but no longer sufficient, for activist social change as earlier theories posit.

Purpose: This project will provide timely insights on contemporary phenomena for media professionals and social change advocates while productively challenging and extending current understandings of social change.

Methodology: This project will employ a post-positivist complexity research paradigm and systems thinking approach to critically assess current theoretical frameworks, propose an alternative, then comparatively analyze this framework in case studies from India and Nigeria.

Feminist Foreign Policy (FFP). 
Specific idea: 
To produce an in-depth evaluation of Sweden's FFP by focusing on an aspect of it that has been underrepresented in the literature: their foreign aid.This is especially relevant since Sweden was the first country in the world to officially adopt a FFP, and have been a trailblazer since. 
Approach and Intended Outcomes: 
First, delving into what FFP is. This could include a philosophical analysis of feminist theories and how they can apply to international relations/foreign policy, as well as a literature review of what FFP is.
Then, exploring Sweden’s FFP and conducting a discourse analysis to better understand the principles and theories that underly it. 
Afterwards, conducting a normative discussion about how feminist Sweden's foreign aid is in theory, as well as whether foreign aid can be feminist in principle. 
Then, exploring whether Sweden's FFP is empirically feminist.

The 2017 - 2018 Minerva Wellness Survey finds that Minerva students report a higher level of loneliness and depression compared to the ACHA - NCHA II reference group (Minerva Schools at KGI, 2018). This capstone project will adopt motivation and behavior-change theories to analyze the limitations of current CAPS programs, which mostly target highly motivated students who care a lot about their own mental health state but excluding those with low motivation in mental health care. Then, I will propose to complement the current CAPS limitation by designing a theory-based educational intervention. Specifically, I will design a series of scientific-based infographics to help increase low-motivated college students’ awareness, knowledge, and self-care skills in mental health.

The intended deliverables will contain the following parts:
1. An analysis on why some students might possess low motivation in mental healthcare using motivation and behavior-change theories.
2. Literature reviews on Minervan’s mental health vulnerability and a gap analysis on the limitation of current Minerva CAPS services using previous Minerva students’ capstone projects.

In its Integrated Learning Outcomes, Minerva University defined its goal to promote self-management and wellness among the student population. Implementation of this learning outcome needs to become more intentional to be successful. Mental Health Literacy, or the ability to understand, and maintain positive mental health, decrease stigma, and navigate through challenges as well as supporting others, is crucial to improve student wellbeing at Minerva. In this Capstone, I analyze the potential of peer support initiatives to improve student mental health literacy and wellbeing at the university level including ethical frameworks, empirical support, and different models of peer support. From this conceptual understanding, I provide an insight into the unique aspects of the Minerva education, their interaction with the Mental Health of students, and current systems of support such as Counseling and Psychological Services (CAPS), covering topics such as stigmatization, and cultural differences in the perception of Mental Health. I will then propose a list of recommendations to implement peer support at Minerva to improve Mental Health Literacy among the student body by giving the empirical framework for effective peer support and suggestions for training curriculum and integration into existing Minerva structures.

Ultimately, this guide will synthesize existing research and insights on ESG and will offer a hands-on recommendation report on how to capitalize on existing gaps in the market. The desired outcome of this deliverable is to give companies an insight into a hot-topic but daunting and relatively new topic within finance.

Such a phenomenon is best addressed with complexity theory. Having sufficient knowledge and research abilities to contribute to a novel interdisciplinary field of complexity theory, I prove that corruption in Ukraine’s business sector is a complex adaptive system. Further, I demonstrate that such systems need to be analyzed using complexity theory, which allows us to break down the phenomenon into tractable components, analyze them, and propose a solution for intervention in the form of a policy program. As such, Ukraine's corruption in the business sector is a complex adaptive system, the harmful effects of which can be best tackled using complexity theory, helping to break down the problem into tractable parts and propose solutions that will tackle each of them. 
To achieve the goal, I conduct a literature review that explores the current works on corruption and its classification as a complex adaptive system. Further, I analyze the applicability of complexity theory to corruption in the business sector in Ukraine. The yielded analysis allows me to apply complexity theory to the Ukrainian business context and examine how complexity theory can guide the creation of plausible and compelling anti-corruption policies and programs.

1- Does not identify corruption types correctly; fails to explain how agents use them and how they affect the system.
2- Somewhat accurately identifies corruption types; explains how agents use them and how they only somewhat correctly affect the system.
3- Accurately identifies the types of corruption, how the agents use them and explain their effects on the system.
4- Identifies corruption types and explains how agents use them and how they affect the system in a detailed and sophisticated manner while also justifying the answer.
5- Identifies corruption types and explains how agents use them and how they affect the system in a novel manner.

These facilities promote animal abuse and keep dolphins in terrible living conditions. In this paper, I will present reasons why the closure of dolphinariums is necessary for protecting the dolphin population. My capstone will address the lack of the necessary legislation that would provide adequate dolphin protection in Ukraine. I will analyze existing successful legislations that provide adequate dolphin protection as well as historic reasons that policies were created. I will build on this analysis to create a policy proposal that would help to limit the commercial activity of dolphinariums in Ukraine and provide adequate dolphin protection.
Intended diliverables: my capstone will have 3 main parts. Description of hdolphin's high cognetive capacity and why it is especially important that they are protected; analysis of policies that lead to the bann of dolphinariums in other countries; a policy proposal for Ukraine.
I will mainly rely on research for compliting this capstone.","Dolphins, dolphinarium bann, animal crualty, policy proposal","Secondary research (e.g., literature review with analysis/synthesis and proposal for future work), Interview/survey, Policy analysis/proposal",Reviewed by HSR committee: *NOT* HSR,I plan to develop my skills writing a policy proposal.,"#NS166effectivesolutions
